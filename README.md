HoneyRJ
=======

HoneyRJ is a low-interaction honeypot written in Java. A
low-interaction honeypot serves a number of limited functionality
protocols with the intent of capturing the source of traffic coming to
the honeypot. A honeypot is located on an IP address that is used
solely for the purpose of the honeypot and not for any legitimate
services; any connections to the software are presumed to be malicious
and are logged for later review. HoneyRJ was designed to be extremely
simple and easily extendable.

## Project History

HoneyRJ was written in Spring 2009 as part of a course project for
CSE571S: Network Security at Washington University in St. Louis.
